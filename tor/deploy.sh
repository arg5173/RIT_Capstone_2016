#!/bin/bash

# Welcome! This script is used to deploy all of the roles tor can assume on an ubuntu machine, it supports:
# DA - Directory Authority
# RELAY - Relay node
# EXIT - Exit node
# CLIENT - A Client in the private network
# HS - A hidden service
#
# The script requires that a Utility server has been deployed using the launch_util.sh script
# It takes two arguments the first is the above role you would like to deploy and the second is the ip address of the utility server
# Example: bash deploy.sh DA 172.16.106.155 (Will deploy a directory authority with a utility ip of 172.16.106.155
# Example: bash deploy.sh RELAY 172.16.106.155 (Will deploy a relay node with a utility ip of 172.16.106.155)

# When run this script will install all of the necessary dependencies for tor including the binary itself and will scp the global DAs file from the utility server
# to obtain the current list of Directory Authorities within the network. If you are deploying a directory authority the script will automatically generate its DA line
# and store it in the global DAs file on the Util server.

# There are different sections to this script depending on what role you deploy, there are global configuration options that need to be included in the torrc file



# Incase you are running this on a machine that has already been deployed it will remove any files that could cause problems
# from previous deployments

# Delete existing tor on box
echo > /etc/tor/torrc		# echo > onto any file will empty it out effectivly clearing torrc
rm -r /var/lib/tor/keys		# Remove the keys directory incase it was a DA	


# Define Variables
ROLE=$1				# Role will either be DA, RELAY, CLIENT, EXIT, or HS passed in from the command line
UTIL_SERVER=$2			# The IP address of the Utility server passed in from the command line
TOR_DIR="/var/lib/tor"		# Defining the Tor directory
TOR_ORPORT=7000			# Defining the Tor OrPort  (port number is arbitrary)
TOR_DIRPORT=9898		# Defining the Tor DirPort (port number is arbitrary)
